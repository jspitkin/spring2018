\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{What was the hardest part of the assignment for you?}
	
The trickiest part of this assignment for me was getting the probability distribution I was calculating correct.
	\item \textbf{What was the easiest part of the assignment for you?}
	
I didn't hit any roadblocks when completing this project and was able to finish in a reasonable time.
	\item \textbf{What problem(s) helped further your understanding of the course material?}

I was having issues with my code timing out but then I switched how I was sampling. The two sampling functions don't differ much but they make a big time difference. It was interesting to see those decisions matter.
	\item \textbf{Did you feel any problems were tedious and not helpful to your understanding of the
material?}

I didn't.
	\item \textbf{What other feedback do you have about this homework?}

Fun last assignment. Overall I had a lot of fun with the Pacman framework.
